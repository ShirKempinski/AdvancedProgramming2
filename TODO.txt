SERVICE:
* when server receives closeCommand, it should inform all open GUIs that this handler has closed.
* properly close server (notify all clients)

GUI:
* design nicer pages! (Uglyness in general)

* WHY ISN'T IT BLUE?!?! :'( #SoSad
* before closure, will send the SERVICE a message that it's closed (onCloseWindow)
* EMPTY LINES
